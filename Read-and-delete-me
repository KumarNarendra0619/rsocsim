# rsoc - preliminary socsim R package

## Installation

I am not entirely sure whether you need to have RTools installed. Please report back if you were able to use this package without RTools!

* install devtools
````
install.packages("devtools")
````

* install Rcpp (I am also not really sure whether you really need rcpp. Maybe not)
````
install.packages("rcpp")

* install rsoc from Github with devtools:
````
devtools::install_github("tomthe/rsoc")

## Use rsoc

````
library("rsoc")

folder = "D:\\dev\\r\\socsimprojects\\CousinDiversity" # specify the working directory, where your supfile and ratefiles are
supfile = "CousinDiversity.sup" # name of the sup-file, relative to the above folder
seed="33" # Random number generator seed

# try one of these functions to run a simulation:
rsoc::run1simulationwithfile(folder,supfile,seed)
# the above function starts a new process to run a simulation.
# advantage: if you run several simulations, they will not interfere with each other
# disadvantages: May not work. No proper output to the R-output (so you don't see how far into the simulation you are, until it finishes

rsoc::run1simulationwithfile_inprocess(folder,supfile,seed)
# the above function runs socsim in the R-process

````

## Develop the package

You need RTools, devtools and rcpp.
Clone this repository, change something, hit "Build--clean and rebuild"

renew documentation and some stuff with:
```` devtools.document()````
