\usage{
run1simulationwithfile(
  folder,

\arguments{
\item{folder}{base-directory of the simulation.}

\item{supfile}{the .sup file to start the simulation, relative to the
folder}

\item{seed}{RNG seed as string, Default="42"}

\item{process_method}{specify whether and how SOCSIM should be started in its
own process or in the running R process. Use one of
 "inprocess" - SOCSIM runs in the R-process. Beware if you run several different
 simulations - they may affect later simulations
 "future" - the safest option. A new process will be start via the "future"
 package
 "clustercall" - if the future package is not available, try this method instead}
